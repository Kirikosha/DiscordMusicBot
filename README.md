# Discord Music Bot with .NET

## Description

I have seen a lot of different music bots for DS on the Internet. Most of them are written in Python because it is easy to write them with this particular programming language. By the way, I am currently studying .NET, and I was very curious if I could write an adequate music bot on C# using different .NET libraries. At first, I tried a Discord.NET library, but unfortunately, my skills and knowing are not so good to use it, so I decided to change the library and found an easy-to-start library called Dsharpplus. Therefore, this bot was built with this particular library. 
I suppose that all music bots that were created for Discord and for others kinds of text/voice messengers have one particular purpose for being created. It is playing music without opening the side app. So that is the purpose of this current bot.
As for me, I think I didn't gain a lot of new knowledge. But I can say that I have gained useful experience and understanding the importance of detailed documentation. Further, I gained an understanding of my current skill level.

## Installation
Caution! You shouldn't rename the folder name of the project.
The installation is simple by default. Download a zip archive from GitHub and unpack it. The only thing you should change is a Token in Config.json. You should replace it with your own bot token.

## Usage

The instructions are pretty simple. To make it play music, you should start the bot and enter the voice chat. Then you need to send a text message that corresponds to the following format: "!play music_name". 
To set music on pause, you have to send the following text message: "!pause.".
To stop the bot and make it leave the VC, you have to send "!stop"
